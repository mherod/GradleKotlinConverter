Gradle Kotlin DSL converter
=================

Welcome! After a lot of pain trying to migrate from Gradle's Groovy to Kotlin DSL on Android Studio, I developed this tool to solve most migration issues and reduce the amount of work you need in order to make things ready.

Please see this tool as a helper, a first resource like Android Studio's Java converter to Kotlin: it won't make a _perfect_ conversion, but it helps a lot in reducing the time you would spend on repetitive tasks.


ðŸ’» Getting Started
---------------
The script was written in Kotlin and depends on JVM (for File access). If you need to install Kotlin for command line access, [check here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html) (`brew install kotlin` or `scoop install kotlin -g` on windows with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)).

```
File mode:
$ ./gradlekotlinconverter.kts build.gradle
$ kotlinc -script gradlekotlinconverter.kts build.gradle

Clipboard mode:
$ ./gradlekotlinconverter.kts
```

**Motivation**: on my own apps, I've used apostrophes \' instead of quotation marks \" since forever, so it wasn't fun when I discovered I would need to modify more than 100 lines of code to make Kotlin DSL work. Besides this, the tool also solves a few common issues that might appear, like the ```task clean(type: Delete)``` that becomes a completely different thing.


ðŸ“‹ Clipboard mode
---------------
Sometimes you just want to copy and paste. Just copy whatever you want, run the script, then paste on your IDE.
The GIF showcases how simple it is:

You can find all the details on the source code.

The script was made to convert `build.gradle` in `build.gradle.kts`, but it can also help in the migration if you paste something that is not in Kotlin DSL format
and you want it converted. If you paste something like a `implementation '...'` and want it converted to `implementation("...")`, you are free to call the script on `build.gradle.kts` file and see it working as expected.

When applying on `build.gradle`, the script will create, for example, `build.gradle.kts`.
When applying on a file that already ends in `.kts`, the script will overrite the file.
In that case, please make sure you are using git or have a backup, in case things turn out wrong.
